Hello! I'm pretty new on Github! Some days ago I found my old ITroublveTSC directory and a repost with some changes from someone else. Enjoy this small repost with a hopefully easy tutorial.


As I said - I'm new üëã, but I will try my best ‚ô°
And yes, if you wanna call me that, you can call me a skid. That is the only thing I can do at the moment, but I'm trying to create my own projects. 


I'm learning coding at the moment to create my own projects as I mentioned before, but I'm pretty young and broke, so please don't hate me for posting this stuff :)
